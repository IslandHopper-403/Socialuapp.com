                <h2 id="cao-lau">1. Cao Lau (High Floor Noodles) üçú</h2>
                
                <p><strong>This is THE dish that defines Hoi An.</strong> Cao Lau features thick, chewy noodles that are supposedly only authentic when made with water from the Ba Le Well in Hoi An. The dish combines Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese influences with char siu-style pork, fresh greens, crispy rice crackers, and a rich broth.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The noodles have a texture unlike any other Vietnamese noodle dish‚Äîslightly chewy and almost udon-like. Legend says the noodles must be washed in water from the ancient Ba Le Well and the ash from trees on the nearby Cham Islands for their distinctive texture.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cao Lau Ba Le</strong> - 45-51 Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫ (across from the market). The most famous spot, family-run for decades. 30,000 VND (~$1.20)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cao Lau Thanh</strong> - 26 Th√°i Phi√™n. Locals swear this is the best, often with a line out the door. 35,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Cao Lau Kh√¥ng Gian Xanh</strong> - 52 Phan Ch√¢u Trinh. Beautiful garden setting, slightly more upscale. 50,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Order "Cao Lau kh√¥" if you want less broth, or "Cao Lau n∆∞·ªõc" for more soup. Most locals prefer it dry.</p>

                <h2 id="white-rose">2. White Rose Dumplings (B√°nh Bao B√°nh V·∫°c) üåπ</h2>

                <p>These delicate steamed dumplings are named for their rose-like appearance. Paper-thin translucent rice wrappers are hand-formed into flower shapes and filled with minced shrimp or pork, then topped with crispy shallots and served with a tangy dipping sauce.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> Only one family in Hoi An knows the traditional recipe, and they supply most restaurants in town. The wrappers are so thin you can see through them, and the pleating technique has been passed down through generations.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>White Rose Restaurant (original family)</strong> - 533 Hai B√† Tr∆∞ng. This is THE place‚Äîthe family that invented them. 60,000 VND for 10 pieces</li>
                    <li><strong>Hoa H·ªìng Tr·∫Øng</strong> - Multiple locations in Ancient Town. Same family's other outlet. 50,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Morning Glory</strong> - 106 Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc. Upscale setting, excellent quality. 80,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Budget hack:</strong> Buy from the family's small shop on Hai B√† Tr∆∞ng instead of restaurants‚Äîsame quality, half the price. Perfect for eating on a tight budget (check out our <a href="hoi-an-on-20-dollars-day.html">$20 per day guide</a> for more money-saving tips).</p>

                <h2 id="banh-mi">3. B√°nh M√¨ Ph∆∞·ª£ng ü•ñ</h2>

                <p>Vietnam's famous baguette sandwich reaches legendary status in Hoi An, thanks to B√°nh M√¨ Ph∆∞·ª£ng‚Äîa humble street stall that gained international fame after Anthony Bourdain visited in 2009.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The perfect crusty-outside, soft-inside baguette (a French colonial legacy) stuffed with p√¢t√©, various meats, pickled vegetables, fresh cilantro, and chili. Ph∆∞·ª£ng's version has a perfect ratio of ingredients and a secret sauce recipe.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>B√°nh M√¨ Ph∆∞·ª£ng</strong> - 2B Phan Ch√¢u Trinh. The original and still the best. 25,000 VND (~$1)</li>
                    <li><strong>B√°nh M√¨ Madame Kh√°nh</strong> - 115 Tr·∫ßn Cao V√¢n. Another legendary spot, "The Queen of B√°nh M√¨." 20,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Madam Lan</strong> - Small cart near An Hoi Bridge. Local favorite, often fresher bread. 20,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Ordering tip:</strong> Point at what you want if you don't speak Vietnamese. "ƒê·∫ßy ƒë·ªß" (doy-doo) means "everything on it." Ask for "√≠t ·ªõt" if you want less chili.</p>

                <h2 id="mi-quang">4. M√¨ Qu·∫£ng üç≤</h2>

                <p>This is Central Vietnam's signature noodle dish‚Äîturmeric-yellow noodles in a small amount of intensely flavorful broth, topped with shrimp, pork, quail eggs, peanuts, and herbs. Unlike pho, it's served with just enough liquid to coat the noodles.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The turmeric gives the noodles a beautiful golden color and earthy flavor. The combination of textures‚Äîchewy noodles, crunchy peanuts, crispy rice crackers‚Äîmakes every bite interesting.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M√¨ Qu·∫£ng 1A</strong> - 1 Tr∆∞∆°ng Minh L∆∞∆°ng. Consistently excellent, always busy with locals. 40,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>M√¨ Qu·∫£ng B√† Mua</strong> - 8 Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i. Family recipe, incredible depth of flavor. 35,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Qu√°n M√¨ Qu·∫£ng H∆∞∆°ng</strong> - 84 Phan Ch√¢u Trinh. Great for late lunch. 40,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to eat it:</strong> Mix everything together thoroughly before eating. Add the rice crackers just before you start eating so they stay crunchy.</p>

                <h2 id="banh-bao-banh-vac">5. B√°nh Bao B√°nh V·∫°c (White Rose's Cousin) ü•ü</h2>

                <p>Often confused with White Rose dumplings, these are thicker wrappers formed into little bags filled with ground shrimp. They're served in a savory broth with herbs, making them more substantial than their rose-shaped cousins.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The name means "basket dumpling" because they look like tiny baskets. The wrappers are chewier than White Rose, and serving them in broth makes this more of a complete meal.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>B√°nh V·∫°c B√† B√©</strong> - Near the Japanese Bridge. Old woman who's been making them for 40+ years. 40,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Vy's Market Restaurant</strong> - 2 Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫. Upscale setting with traditional recipes. 70,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="com-ga">6. C∆°m G√† (Chicken Rice) üçó</h2>

                <p>Hoi An's version of chicken rice is influenced by the Hainanese Chinese community. Fragrant rice cooked in chicken broth, topped with shredded chicken, fresh herbs, and a zingy lime and chili sauce.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The rice is incredibly aromatic from being cooked in chicken stock, and the accompanying papaya salad adds a perfect acidic crunch. It's comfort food at its finest.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C∆°m G√† B√† Bu·ªôi</strong> - 22 Phan Chu Trinh. The most famous, always packed. 40,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>C∆°m G√† H·ªôi An</strong> - 13 Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. Locals' choice, often with a wait. 35,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="banh-xeo">7. B√°nh X√®o (Sizzling Pancakes) ü•û</h2>

                <p>A crispy, turmeric-tinted rice flour crepe filled with pork, shrimp, bean sprouts, and herbs. "X√®o" is the sizzling sound it makes when the batter hits the hot pan.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The perfect b√°nh x√®o should be paper-thin and shatteringly crisp on the outside. You wrap pieces in rice paper with fresh herbs and dip in a sweet-savory peanut sauce.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>B√°nh X√®o B√† D∆∞·ª°ng</strong> - 45 Tr·∫ßn Cao V√¢n. The crispiest in town. 50,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Morning Glory</strong> - 106 Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i H·ªçc. Upscale version, still authentic. 90,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to eat it:</strong> Cut a piece with scissors, wrap in lettuce or rice paper with herbs, dip in sauce. Don't overthink it‚Äîjust experiment!</p>

                <h2 id="vietnamese-coffee">8. Vietnamese Coffee ‚òï</h2>

                <p>Vietnamese coffee is strong, sweet, and typically served over ice with sweetened condensed milk. It's a ritual in Hoi An‚Äîlocals spend hours at coffee shops socializing.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> Vietnamese coffee uses robusta beans and a metal drip filter (phin), creating an intensely strong, almost chocolatey brew. The condensed milk balances the bitterness perfectly.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M√≥t Hoi An</strong> - 106 Phan Ch√¢u Trinh. Hip caf√© with excellent coffee and river views. 35,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Hoi An Roastery</strong> - 135 Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫. Small-batch roasters, beans from local highlands. 40,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Reaching Out Teahouse</strong> - 131 Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫. Social enterprise, peaceful garden. 40,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to order:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"C√† ph√™ s·ªØa ƒë√°" = iced coffee with milk (the classic)</li>
                    <li>"C√† ph√™ ƒëen" = black coffee</li>
                    <li>"C√† ph√™ s·ªØa n√≥ng" = hot coffee with milk</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="che">9. Ch√® (Sweet Dessert Soup) üçß</h2>

                <p>These sweet dessert soups come in countless varieties with combinations of beans, jellies, fruits, coconut milk, and ice. Perfect for cooling down in Hoi An's heat.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The variety is endless‚Äîfrom simple mung bean ch√® to elaborate rainbow versions with 10+ ingredients. It's sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and incredibly refreshing.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to find the best:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ch√® H√πng B·ªën</strong> - 75 Phan Chu Trinh. Over 20 varieties. 25,000 VND</li>
                    <li><strong>Ch√® B√† Di·ªáu</strong> - Multiple locations. Clean, modern, perfect for first-timers. 30,000 VND</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="banh-dap">10. B√°nh ƒê·∫≠p (Smashed Rice Cracker) ü•†</h2>

                <p>This unique Hoi An snack consists of two thin rice crackers that you smash together, then top with a quail egg, dried shrimp, and herbs. It's crunchy, savory, and slightly addictive.</p>

                <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The theatrical smashing is part of the fun. The crackers shatter into bite-sized pieces that you can eat like chips, and the combination of textures is incredibly satisfying.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Street vendors</strong> - Around Hoi An Market and Ancient Town. 10,000 VND per serving</li>

                <p><strong>Food safety tips:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for busy places with high turnover (fresher ingredients)</li>
                    <li>Stick to cooked foods if you have a sensitive stomach</li>
                    <li>Drink bottled or filtered water only</li>
                    <li>Most reputable places are very safe‚Äîdon't be too paranoid!</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Using your phone for navigation:</strong> Save restaurant addresses in Google Maps before heading out. Most places don't have WiFi, so download an offline map. The Ancient Town is small enough to walk everywhere‚Äîmost of these spots are within a 10-minute walk of each other. If you need help getting around, our <a href="getting-around-hoi-an-transport-guide.html">complete transport guide</a> covers bicycles, scooters, and walking routes.</p>

                <p><strong>Market shopping:</strong> For an authentic experience, visit Hoi An Central Market early morning (6-8 AM). You'll see locals buying ingredients and can try fresh fruits, Vietnamese sandwiches, and local coffee at a fraction of restaurant prices.</p>

                <p><strong>Dietary restrictions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vegetarian:</strong> Say "ƒÉn chay" (an chay). Many Buddhist restaurants in town.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vegan:</strong> More challenging but possible. Specify "kh√¥ng tr·ª©ng, kh√¥ng s·ªØa" (no eggs, no milk)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gluten-free:</strong> Most rice noodle dishes are naturally GF, but confirm no soy sauce</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Cooking classes:</strong> Want to learn to make these dishes? Several excellent cooking classes cost $25-35 and include market tours, hands-on cooking, and recipe cards to take home. Red Bridge Cooking School and Gioan Cooking Class are highly recommended.</p>

                <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> The best meals in Hoi An often come from the humblest-looking places. Don't be afraid to eat where the locals eat‚Äîthat's where the magic happens. If a place has no English menu and locals are happily slurping away, you're probably in for something delicious. And remember, pointing at what someone else is eating works in every language!</p>

                <p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Time your visit around the <a href="hoi-an-lantern-festival-guide.html">Full Moon Lantern Festival</a> for special festival foods and night market treats you won't find any other time. The food scene during festival nights is absolutely magical.</p>
